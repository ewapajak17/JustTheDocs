# What is phishing
Phishing is a method used by scammers to trick you into giving them your personal and financial information. You may receive an e-mail (phishing) or SMS (smishing) which appears to be sent by your bank or another institution or company that you know and trust. The sender asks you to give your personal information like username and password. The purpose of such messages is to encourage you to click a link or open an attachment.
Be careful when the message says that:
- there is some suspicious activity or log-in attempt in your account,
- there is some problem with your bank account,
- your account is on hold because of a billing problem,
- you need to give your username and/or password,
- you need to click some link to make a payment or update your personal or payment details,
- you should pay an invoice you don’t recognize
- you should pay your electricity bill through the link sent in the message,
- you won the lottery or received a voucher for free stuff,
- you inherited money from a distant relative
- someone paid you money and to receive it you should click the link
	
## WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE UNSURE
Check the extension of the attachment to your e-mail (.exe, .js, .iso, .img, .htm, .html may indicate a scam). 

## REMEMBER
A phishing message is strikingly similar to the message sent by the true sender. An e-mail may contain a company’s logo and your name in the greetings. Very often it is difficult to tell the difference between a fake message/website and a real one.

## How to recognize a phishing e-mail?
- it may contain grammatical errors, misspellings or odd phrases,
- check the logo (it may be very tiny or indistinct as scammers might just copy it),
- hover over the link’s URL (if it doesn’t belong to the company which sent the message, that may be suspicious),
