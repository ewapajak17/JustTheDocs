# What is spoofing?

**Spoofing** is a method used by scammers who pretend to be someone else to gain the user’s trust and steal information. Malicious software may be installed on the user’s computer.
Example: You get a phone call from someone who pretends to be from your bank. The caller informs you that someone broke into your account or made some suspicious transaction. Next, the caller asks you to give your confidential data and install software to protect your data. Then, software gives them control over your device. The scammer changes your password and withdraws money from your account.

## BE CAREFUL:

-	When you get a phone call from someone who pretends to be a bank employee, policeman, or civil servant. Don’t give them any information like your personal details, address, password and so on. Instead, offer to call them back, but check the phone number on the official website first.
-	When you get a phone call from the number you know, and the caller asks you for money or to do something urgently saying that your relative’s or friend’s life or health is at stake. The number may be forged and you may be a victim of a scam.  

## STAY CALM
-	Do not act in a hurry.
-	Contact someone who you trust for advice.
-	If a phone call seems suspicious, disconnect and contact the institution from which the caller allegedly called by phone, e-mail or sms.
-	Do not install any software or programs that the caller asks you to.
-	Do not make money transfer or withdraw money.
