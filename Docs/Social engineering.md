# What is social engineering?

**Social engineering** (in the context of cyber security) is a psychological manipulation technique used to convince people to disclose their personal information, download malicious software, visit suspicious websites, or pay money to criminals. Social engineering attacks are effective as they play on human emotions. 
Why people are subject to social engineering attacks 
-	they often induce fear or a sense of urgency; victims react in a hurry or under stress, without a second thought
-	criminals pose as brands or institutions which victims know and trust
